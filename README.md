# Excel Dashboard NFL Punt Concussion Analysis

## About

NFL ([National Football League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League)) is a proffessional [Ameriacan Football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football) [league](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_league), that usually takes place from early September to December. In American and Canadian football, a punt is a kick performed by dropping the ball from the hands and then kicking the ball before it hits the ground. [follow this link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punt_(gridiron_football)) for more information on Punt.

The competition was hosted to allow competitors to propose specific rule modifications based on the data provided by NFL for all punt plays from the 2016 and 2017 NFL seasons that includes player rosters, on-field position data and video data, including the plays in which a player suffered a concussion.

This Excel file contains Dashboard and other visualizations related to above said data. I have used Pivot tables, Pivot Charts, VLOOKUP, Conditional Formating, Slicers and other tools available in Excel for this project.
